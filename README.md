# Computer Engineering degree
## Here you will find my degree work. It is organised in folders, one for each subject.

The knowlegde obtained in each subject:
## First year
### First Semester

[Calculus]
Credits: 6
* Differential calculus in one variable.
* Integral calculus in one variable.
* Numerical methods for differential and integral calculus.
* Numerical algorithms.

[Physics]
### Second Semester
* Fundamental concepts 

## Second year
### First Semester

[Concurrent and Distributed Systems](./concurrent-and-distributed-systems)
* Mutual exclusion, synchronization and communication between processes.
* Safety and liveliness properties.
* Algorithm based on shared memory and message passing.
* Semaphores and monitors.
* Concurrent and distributed programming libraries.
* Techniques for real-time applications design.

[Data Structure](./data-structure)
* Introduction to algorithm efficiency.
* Abstract Data Type (ADT).
* Specification and implementation of ADT: lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs.

[PDOO](./object-oriented-programming-and-design)
* Concepts, techniques and notations.
* Classes and objects.
* Polimorfism.
* Inheritance.
* Design with polimorfism and inheritance.
* Complex objects: components, aspects and frameworks.

### Second Semester
This semester will be finished by June 2023, until then this part will be empty. The reason is the possible copy from other students and its consecuences.
